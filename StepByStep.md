1. Setting the Objective and Choosing Tools
Detect the presence of Mimikatz malware on a system running a Wazuh agent.
Plan the workflow 
2. Designing the Lab
Create a lab diagram to visualize on draw.io
3. Setting Up the Lab
Step 1: Create a Virtual Machine for Windows 10 and Sysmon

Download the Windows 10 ISO from the Microsoft website.
Use VirtualBox to create a Windows 10 virtual machine.
Install Sysmon to monitor system events:
Download Sysmon from Microsoft.
Run the installer and follow the setup wizard.
Open the Command Prompt and run
sysmon -i to install Sysmon
sysmon -n to start Sysmon
Step 2: Create Virtual Machines for Wazuh and The Hive

Use DigitalOcean to set up two Ubuntu 22.04 LTS virtual machines.
Configure firewall rules to restrict access to your computer only.
Wazuh Setup:
SSH into the VM and install Wazuh.
Configure Wazuh to monitor the Windows VM.
The Hive Setup:
SSH into the second VM and install The Hive.
Modify configuration files (cassandra.yml and elasticsearch.yml) to link to The Hive’s IP address.
Create user and service accounts for integration with Shuffle.
4. Testing the Setup
Install the Wazuh agent on the Windows VM.
Download and run Mimikatz on the Windows VM to generate telemetry.
Verify that Wazuh detects the activity and creates alerts.
Configure Sysmon logs to monitor and log Mimikatz-related events.
5. Automating the Response
Set up a webhook in Shuffle to send telemetry from Wazuh to VirusTotal.
Use VirusTotal's API to analyze the file’s hash reputation.
Enrich the telemetry data with details like timestamps and hostnames.
Send an alert to The Hive, which creates a case and sends an email notification to the SOC analyst.
