Project was based on DFIR on youtube. 

The SOC Automation Lab has been successfully established and configured, integrating Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to deliver streamlined event monitoring, alerting, and incident response. This implementation provides a solid framework for expanding and tailoring automation workflows to meet specific SOC needs.

Key Accomplishments:
A Windows 10 client was configured with Sysmon for generating detailed event logs.
Wazuh was deployed as the central platform for managing events and generating alerts.
TheHive was set up to facilitate case management and enable coordinated incident response.
Custom alerts were created in Wazuh using telemetry data from Mimikatz.
Shuffle was integrated as the SOAR platform to automate workflows effectively.
An automated workflow was developed to:
Extract file hashes.
Analyze reputation scores via VirusTotal.
Trigger alerts in TheHive.
Send email notifications to SOC analysts.
This lab provided practical experience in designing and implementing an automated SOC workflow using robust open-source tools. The insights gained can be applied to enhance security operations, accelerate incident response, and optimize SOC processes.

Recommendations for Ongoing Development:
Continuously adapt and improve workflows to address evolving security threats, integrate emerging tools, and meet organizational goals.
Regularly update SOC playbooks and incorporate new threat intelligence sources to strengthen defenses.
Explore advanced functionalities within Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to expand the automation capabilities of the SOC.
By harnessing the power of automation and leveraging the features of Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle, organizations can create a highly efficient and resilient SOC. This proactive approach enables effective detection and rapid response to security incidents while reducing operational burdens.
