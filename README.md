We have successfully established and configured the SOC Automation Lab, integrating Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to enable automated event monitoring, alerting, and incident response. This setup serves as a robust foundation for further customization and expansion of automation workflows to align with specific SOC requirements.

Key Achievements:
Configured a Windows 10 client with Sysmon for detailed event generation.
Deployed Wazuh as the central platform for event management and alerting.
Installed and set up TheHive for efficient case management and coordinated response actions.
Generated Mimikatz telemetry and created custom alerts within Wazuh.
Integrated Shuffle as the SOAR platform to streamline workflow automation.
Developed an automated workflow to:
Extract file hashes.
Check reputation scores using VirusTotal.
Create alerts in TheHive.
Notify SOC analysts via email.
Through this lab, we gained hands-on experience in implementing an automated SOC workflow using advanced open-source tools. This knowledge can now be applied to enhance security operations, improve incident response times, and streamline SOC processes.

Next Steps:
Continuously refine and adapt automation workflows in response to evolving threats, emerging tools, and changing organizational needs.
Regularly review and update SOC playbooks, incorporating new threat intelligence sources.
Explore and implement advanced features of Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle to further enhance capabilities.
By embracing automation and leveraging the combined strengths of Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle, organizations can build a more efficient, proactive, and resilient SOC that excels in detecting and responding to security incidents.
